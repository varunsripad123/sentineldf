# SentinelDF â€” Data Firewall for LLM Training

**Protect Your AI from Poisoned Training Data**

---

## The Problem

LLM training datasets are under attack. Adversaries inject:

- **Prompt injection attacks** that hijack model behavior
- **Backdoor triggers** that activate malicious responses
- **HTML/JavaScript payloads** from scraped web content
- **Adversarial examples** designed to corrupt learning

**Consequences:**
- Degraded model performance
- Compliance violations (AI regulations, data sovereignty)
- Reputational damage from biased or harmful outputs
- Expensive retraining cycles

**Current tools miss these threats** because they focus on syntax, not semantics.

---

## The Solution

**SentinelDF scans your datasets, detects threats, and signs trusted receipts.**

### How It Works

```
Input Dataset â†’ Dual Detection â†’ Risk Fusion â†’ Quarantine Decision â†’ Signed MBOM
                (Heuristic +        (weighted      (threshold    (audit trail)
                 Embedding)         scoring)       enforcement)
```

**1. Heuristic Detector**
- 30+ high-severity pattern rules
- Co-occurrence detection (e.g., "ignore" + "instructions")
- ALL-CAPS imperative detection
- HTML/JS injection patterns

**2. Embedding Outlier Detector**
- SBERT sentence transformers (384-dim vectors)
- Isolation Forest anomaly detection
- Catches novel attacks via distributional drift

**3. Risk Fusion**
- Weighted combination (default: 0.4 heuristic, 0.6 embedding)
- Produces 0-100 risk score per document
- Configurable quarantine threshold (default: 70)

**4. Signed MBOMs**
- HMAC-SHA256 cryptographic signatures
- Tamper-proof audit trails for compliance
- Batch summaries + per-document risk details

## Key Features

### ðŸ”’ Security First
- **Local-only processing** - No cloud dependencies, runs on your CPU
- **Zero network calls** - Air-gap compatible, no data exfiltration
- **Cryptographic signatures** - HMAC-signed audit trails

### ðŸŽ¯ Accurate Detection
- **56% baseline detection** of known poison samples @ 70 threshold
- **0% false positives** on clean data (configurable for your tolerance)
- **Deterministic results** - Same data = same scores (reproducible)

### âš¡ Fast & Scalable
- **100-200 docs/sec** on warm runs (with caching)
- **15-25 docs/sec** on cold runs (CPU-only, no GPU needed)
- **Persistent caching** - 5-10x speedup on repeated scans

### ðŸŽ¨ User-Friendly
- **Streamlit dashboard** - Interactive UI for visual exploration
- **CLI tool** - `sdf scan`, `sdf mbom`, `sdf validate`
- **REST API** - FastAPI endpoints for programmatic access

### ðŸ“Š Compliance Ready
- **SOC 2 aligned** - Audit trails, integrity verification
- **GDPR compliant** - Local processing, no cross-border data transfer
- **HIPAA friendly** - PHI stays on your premises
