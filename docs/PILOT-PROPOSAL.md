# SentinelDF Pilot Program ‚Äî 30-Day Proof of Concept

**Version:** 0.1.0  
**Last Updated:** 2024-10-16

---

## Objective

Validate SentinelDF's ability to detect and quarantine poisoned or prompt-injection samples in your LLM training datasets while maintaining zero external dependencies and full data sovereignty.

**Pilot Goals:**
- Demonstrate detection of known attack patterns (prompt injection, backdoor triggers, HTML/JS payloads)
- Measure false positive rate on clean production data
- Generate cryptographically signed audit trails (MBOMs) for compliance
- Validate performance on your infrastructure (CPU-only, no GPU required)

---

## Scope & Deliverables

### What We'll Scan

**Dataset Size:** Up to 100,000 records  
**Formats Supported:** Plain text, JSON, CSV (with text columns)  
**Processing:** 100% local on your infrastructure - no cloud uploads

### Deliverables

**1. Comprehensive Risk Report**
- Per-document risk scores (0-100 scale)
- Quarantine vs. allow decision matrix
- Detection reasons with interpretable explanations
- Distribution analysis (risk histogram, percentiles)

**2. Signed MBOMs (Material Bill of Materials)**
- HMAC-SHA256 signed audit trails
- Batch-level summaries with statistics
- Per-document risk details
- Verifiable integrity proofs

**3. Interactive Dashboard Access**
- Streamlit UI for visual exploration
- Risk distribution charts
- UMAP embedding visualization (‚â§1000 docs)
- Document-level drill-down

**4. Optional: Live Demo Session** (30-60 minutes)
- Screen-share walkthrough of results
- Q&A on detection logic
- Threshold tuning recommendations
- Integration planning discussion

---

## Success Metrics

### Detection Quality

**Primary Metric:**
- **‚â•70% detection rate** on known poisoned samples at default threshold (70)
- **<10% false positive rate** on verified clean samples

**Secondary Metrics:**
- **Precision:** Percentage of quarantined docs that are true positives
- **Recall:** Percentage of poisoned docs successfully caught
- **F1 Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall

### Performance

**Target Benchmarks:**
- **End-to-end scan time:** ‚â§15 minutes for 100K records (8-core CPU)
- **Throughput:** ~100-200 docs/sec on warm runs (with caching)
- **Memory footprint:** <4GB RAM for batch processing

### Operational

- **Zero external API calls** - all processing local
- **Reproducibility** - same data yields same scores (deterministic)
- **Audit readiness** - MBOM signatures validate correctly

## Security & Compliance

### Data Protection

‚úÖ **Local-only processing** - No data transmitted to external servers  
‚úÖ **No cloud dependencies** - Runs entirely on your infrastructure  
‚úÖ **No telemetry** - Zero phone-home behavior  
‚úÖ **Air-gap compatible** - Works without internet access

### Cryptographic Assurance

- **HMAC-SHA256 signatures** on all audit trails
- **SHA-256 content hashing** for deduplication
- **Constant-time signature comparison** to prevent timing attacks

### Compliance Readiness

- **SOC 2 Type II aligned** - Audit trail, integrity verification, access controls
- **GDPR compliant** - Local processing, no cross-border data transfer
- **HIPAA friendly** - PHI stays on your premises
- **FedRAMP compatible** - Government air-gap deployments supported

### What We DON'T Collect

- ‚ùå Raw document content
- ‚ùå Personally identifiable information (PII)
- ‚ùå API keys or credentials
- ‚ùå Usage telemetry or analytics

**We only see:**
- Aggregate statistics (counts, averages)
- Detection reasons (high-level patterns)
- Risk score distributions

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can we test on a smaller dataset first?

**A:** Absolutely. We recommend starting with 1,000-10,000 records to validate the approach before scaling to 100K.

### Q: What if we don't have labeled poison samples?

**A:** No problem. We'll analyze your data distribution and flag statistical outliers. You can manually review high-risk samples to build ground truth.

### Q: Does it require GPU acceleration?

**A:** No. SentinelDF runs entirely on CPU (sentence transformers use CPU inference). GPU support is optional and provides ~2-3x speedup.

### Q: Can we run it air-gapped?

**A:** Yes. Download dependencies once, transfer to air-gapped environment. No internet required after initial setup.

### Q: How do we validate MBOM signatures?

**A:** Use the built-in CLI: `sdf validate <mbom_file>`. Returns ‚úÖ if signature matches, ‚ùå if tampered.

### Q: What happens after the pilot?

**A:** You decide:
1. **Proceed to paid tier** - Sign contract, deploy to production
2. **Extend pilot** - Continue evaluation with more data
3. **Pass** - No obligation, we part ways

### Q: Do you offer managed hosting?

**A:** Not currently. SentinelDF is self-hosted on your infrastructure. Managed cloud option coming in Q2 2025.
